A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.\n\n#### Holder object ####\n\nThe `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `\"type\": \"group\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\"parameter\": \"Teams in space administrators\"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:\n\n *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).\n *  `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.\n\nThe following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):\n\n *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.\n *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.\n *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.\n *  `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).\n *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).\n *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.\n *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).\n *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.\n *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.\n *  `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used).\n *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).\n\n#### Built-in permissions ####\n\nThe [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.\n\n**Project permissions**\n\n *  `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS`\n *  `BROWSE_PROJECTS`\n *  `MANAGE_SPRINTS_PERMISSION` (Jira Software only)\n *  `SERVICEDESK_AGENT` (Jira Service Desk only)\n *  `VIEW_DEV_TOOLS` (Jira Software only)\n *  `VIEW_READONLY_WORKFLOW`\n\n**Issue permissions**\n\n *  `ASSIGNABLE_USER`\n *  `ASSIGN_ISSUES`\n *  `CLOSE_ISSUES`\n *  `CREATE_ISSUES`\n *  `DELETE_ISSUES`\n *  `EDIT_ISSUES`\n *  `LINK_ISSUES`\n *  `MODIFY_REPORTER`\n *  `MOVE_ISSUES`\n *  `RESOLVE_ISSUES`\n *  `SCHEDULE_ISSUES`\n *  `SET_ISSUE_SECURITY`\n *  `TRANSITION_ISSUES`\n\n**Voters and watchers permissions**\n\n *  `MANAGE_WATCHERS`\n *  `VIEW_VOTERS_AND_WATCHERS`\n\n**Comments permissions**\n\n *  `ADD_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_COMMENTS`\n\n**Attachments permissions**\n\n *  `CREATE_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_ATTACHMENTS`\n\n**Time tracking permissions**\n\n *  `DELETE_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `WORK_ON_ISSUES`\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.","operationId":"getAllPermissionSchemes","parameters":[{"name":"expand","in":"query","description":"Use expand to include additional information in the response.

This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.\n\nTo expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. \nIf you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a \ncomma-separated list. \n\nFor example, the following request expands the `names` and `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:\n\n`GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`\n\nTo discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property in the object. \nIn the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as expandable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expand\": \"widgets\", \n  \"self\": \"https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1\", \n  \"widgets\": {\n    \"widgets\": [],\n    \"size\": 5\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large \ncollection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in \na JSON object with paging metadata. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"startAt\" : 0,\n    \"maxResults\" : 10,\n    \"total\": 200,\n    \"isLast\": false,\n    \"values\": [\n        { /* result 0 */ },\n        { /* result 1 */ },\n        { /* result 2 */ }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.\n*   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return. Each operation can have a different limit for\n    the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items \n    that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.\n*    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This number **_may change_** as the client \nrequests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note \nthat this property is not returned for all operations.\n*   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note that this property is not returned for all operations.\n\n### Ordering\n\nSome operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field. Check the documentation for the operation to \nconfirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order \nby default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:\n\n*   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.\n\n\n"},{"title":"Special headers","anchor":"special-request-headers","body":"The following request and response headers define important metadata for the Jira Cloud REST API resources.\n\n-   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`\nheader in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.\n-   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the standard HTTP `Accept-Language` header is processed.\nBy default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in the language configured in the user's profile or,\nwhen no language is configured for the user, the default Jira instance language. For the response to recognize\n`Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as well. If `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira\ncan return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira returns the response in the default language.

Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default.

The content of the field is specific to the \noperation that created the task.
