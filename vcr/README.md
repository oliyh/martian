# martian-vcr
`martian-vcr` is a library which allows you to easily record and play back HTTP requests made through martian.

## Usage

You can use martian-vcr in two ways: recording and playback.
Recording captures responses from HTTP requests while playback returns the recorded responses instead of making real requests.

### Record

Take a martian definition and bootstrap it with the extra interceptor `martian.vcr/record`:

```clj
(require '[martian.core :as m])
(require '[martian.interceptors :refer [inject]])
(require '[martian.clj-http :as http])
(require '[martian.vcr :as vcr])

(def routes [{:route-name :load-pet
              :path-parts ["/pets/" :id]
              :method :get
              :path-schema {:id s/Int}}])

;; options for recording/playback - see below
(def opts {:store {:kind :file
                   :root-dir "test-resources/vcr"
                   :pprint? true}})

(def m (http/bootstrap "https://foo.com/api"
                       {:interceptors (inject http/default-interceptors
                                              (vcr/record opts)
                                              :after (:name http/perform-request))}))

(m/response-for m :load-pet {:id 123})
;; the response is recorded and now stored at test-resources/vcr/load-pet/-655390368/0.edn
```

You can populate the directory - use a different one for different test suites - by just making requests as you normally would.

If you need to strip out any sensitive or uninteresting information from the response, simply add another interceptor between `perform-request` and `record` to do this.

### Playback

Given a directory of responses populated by the record interceptor, you can now use the `playback` interceptor to return these responses without making HTTP requests - perfect for a test suite
or working offline.

```clj
(def m (m/bootstrap "https://foo.com/api"
                    {:interceptors (inject http/default-interceptors
                                           (vcr/playback opts)
                                           :before (:name http/perform-request))}))

(m/response-for m :load-pet {:id 123})
;; the response is read from test-resources/vcr/load-pet/-655390368/0.edn and returned
```

### Options

Options are supplied as a map, like this:

```clj
{:store {:kind :file
         :root-dir "target"
         :pprint? true}
 :on-missing-response :generate-404
 :extra-requests :repeat-last}
 ```

The options available are:

#### Store

The `:store` option can be one of the following:

##### File store

For Clojure only:

 ```clj
{:kind :file
 :root-dir "target" ;; where the response files are written
 :pprint? ;; whether to pprint the files (uses fipp)
}
 ```

 ##### Atom store

 For Clojure and Clojurescript:

 ```clj
{:kind :atom
 :store (atom {}) ;; where the reponses are assoced
}
```

#### Missing response behaviour

The `:on-missing-response` allows you to choose between the following behaviours when a response is not in the store during playback:

##### default
If you do not specify, the default behaviour is to do nothing - the context is passed through unchanged.
This can be useful during playback to allow the real request to be made and recorded as a way of augmenting your store.

##### `:throw-error`
An error is thrown which can be handled by another interceptor

##### `:generate-404`
A barebones 404 response is returned

#### Extra requests

vcr will play responses to you in the order they were recorded, enabling playback of mutable webservices (e.g. polling endpoints).

If you make more requests than there are recorded responses, you can choose the behaviour by setting the `:extra-requests` option:

##### `:repeat-last`
The last recorded response will be repeated

##### `:cycle`
The responses will be cycled
